Title: Metamorphian
Genre: Fixed Shooter
Similar Games: Bosconian, Centipede, Galaxian

Mechanics:
    
    Player cannon: The player is a gun much like Centipede and can
    move around the bottom of the screen to fire bullets.
    
    Leave Vines: Provide walls to stop enemies, but leaf sections
    are vulnerable to being eaten thus letting in enemies. There are
    3 wall segments to start
    
    Acorns: Rare special items that give the player limited bullets
    with different abilities
        red: gives the player 2 maggot bullets 
        blue: gives the player a vine grower bullet 
    
    Larva: Emerge from the top of the screen where they eat leaves. 
    When a certain amount of leaves have been eaten, the larva becomes
    a cacoon. 
    
    Cocoon: Is stagnant, but can absorb bullet fire. Larva will build
    cocoons in wall formations to protect larva. Vulnerable to maggot
    larva.
    
    Butterfly: Can fly over anything and lay eggs, but also directly
    attacks the player with bullers. After a butterfly is shot, it's 
    body shoots eggs around it. A normal bullet can destroy the body, 
    but a maggot bullet infects the body of the butterfly.
    
    Bullets:
        normal: kills eggs, larva, and butterflys
        maggot egg: if shot into a dead butterfly it will hatch from
        the body and create Maggot larva.
        vine grower: creates a vine wall wherever it stops.
    
    Maggot Larva: Eat cocoons to be becomal Larval coccoon. Vulnerable
    to regular larva
    
    Maggot Cocoon: Weak to regular larva. They must be protected if
    possible.
    
    Flys: You did it you created a fly. Can only be killed by
    a Butterfly bullet. Flys can eat eggs, larva, and cocoons, but 
    can't hurt butterflys.
    
    Stage Clearing: When a stage is cleared of all enemies, the 3 main
    walls are regrown and more larva spawn.
